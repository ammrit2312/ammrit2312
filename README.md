Hey, this is Amritesh 👋🏻. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in PES University, Bangalore. I am currently working on Web Development projects. 
<br/>
I have a keen interest in Deep Learning especially NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Computer Vision. I am currently exploring the field of Computer Vision. I love working in the domain of Deep Learning because I believe it is one of the most interesting domain at the moment and we as programmers can contribute a loot in this domain.
